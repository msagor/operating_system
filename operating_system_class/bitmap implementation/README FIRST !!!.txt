The document has detailed explanation of how the programs has been designed.

img file has been added for showing that the program compiled on my machine.

kernel.C has been added with custom testing lines. it gets 10 frames from 1003 to 1012, then tries 
to release frame no 1009, whih shows error because it is not a head frame.
Then it successfullt releases all the allocated frames.

Thanks.
